Origin server:
- incoming requests are made to the origin server
- origin server will decide which CDN Node to send the request to by considering
  a. which node (if any) has the file in cache already (consults the meta server)
  b. geographic location
  c. node load (to balance)
- this will be done like a server to make implementing the logic easier for us (versus dns manipulation)
- can be scaled by replicating (cheaply) if under heavy load (our implementation will only have one)
 
Meta server:
- contains a table of which file hashes each cdn node already has in cache
- can be scaled by replicating (cheaply) if under heavy load (our implementation will only have one)
- can be combined with the origin server for a smaller implementation
 
CDN Node servers:
- as a forwarded request comes from the origin either
  - responds if file in cache
  or
  - requests file from data center, also prefetching any other related files
  - because this changes its cache contents, the node must update the meta server
 
Authentication
We have not decided how to manage the authentication, but it will cut in and protect the access between the origin and cdn node
 
Request / Data center program
Because these are not integral components of our design, we will be implementing these only as much as needed to flush the other parts of our design.
